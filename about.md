title: About Me
---

I am a second-year student at UNC Chapel Hill, double majoring in Statistics & Analytics and Economics, with a minor in Data Science. Throughout my time at UNC, I've advanced my knowledge in tools such as Excel, Powerpoint, Tableau, R and Python, and improved my skills in teamwork, communication, and attention to detail. I am looking to apply my skills in data analysis and economics to help organizations make data-driven decisions, with a particular interest in the intersection of data science and business strategy. Extracurriculary, I currently hold leadership positions in Scale and Coin Business Society and Men's Club Volleyball, and I am also a member of the Sports Analytics club, Carolina Analytics and Data Science, and Busi-Tech club. In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, playing volleyball, working out, and fishing. Feel free to reach me at my contact below!
